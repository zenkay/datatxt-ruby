## Usage

_Methods references are taken from [dataTXT documentation](https://dandelion.eu/docs/)._

**dataTXT-NEX**: is a named entity extraction & linking API that performs very well even on short texts, on which many other similar services do not. dataTXT-NEX currently works on English, French, German, Italian and Portuguese texts. With this API you will be able to automatically tag your texts, extracting Wikipedia entities and enriching your data.

```
element = Datatxt::Nex.new
response = element.analyze(text: "This is a test")
```

**dataTXT-SIM**: is a semantic sentence similarity API optimized on short sentences. With this API you will be able to compare two sentences and get a score of their semantic similarity. It works even if the two sentences don't have any word in common.

```
element = Datatxt::Sim.new
response = element.analyze(text1: "This is a test", text2: "This is another test")
```

**dataTXT-LI**: is a simple language identification API; it is a tool that may be useful when dealing with texts, so we decided to open it to all our users. It currently supports more than 50 languages.

```
element = Datatxt::Li.new
response = element.analyze(text: "Questo Ã¨ un test")
```
